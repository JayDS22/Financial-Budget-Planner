## 🏅 Sponsor Tracks & Challenges Addressed

VisionFi was built to address the challenges posed by **three sponsor tracks** at TartanHacks 2026. Below is how each track's problem statement maps to our solution.

<br/>

### 💳 Visa — *"Reimagine the Future of Payments & Financial Management"*

> **Challenge:** Build an innovative solution that improves how consumers manage, track, and optimize their financial lives — leveraging modern payment ecosystems.

| Challenge Area | How VisionFi Addresses It |
|:---------------|:--------------------------|
| **Unified Financial Dashboard** | A single-pane-of-glass view across transactions, budgets, credit cards, loans, subscriptions, and investments — all tied to real card data (Visa, Amex, Mastercard, Discover). |
| **Smart Budget Tracking** | Real-time budget monitoring with AI-categorized transactions, daily/weekly/monthly savings targets, and visual spending breakdowns by category. |
| **Credit Score & Card Management** | Full credit report with score rating, utilization tracking, hard inquiries, and per-card spending analysis — emulating Visa's vision for cardholder empowerment. |
| **AI-Powered Predictions** | ML-based cash-flow forecasting that predicts daily, weekly, and monthly spending patterns so users can stay ahead of bills and avoid overdrafts. |
| **Subscription Intelligence** | A subscription guard that detects unused services, estimates annual waste, and recommends cancellations — protecting consumers from "subscription creep." |
| **Smart Automations** | Automated savings rules (round-ups, under-budget sweeps, daily auto-save) that turn passive card usage into active wealth-building. |

<br/>

### 🏦 Capital One — *"Empower Consumers with Smarter Financial Tools"*

> **Challenge:** Create tools that help consumers make better spending decisions, improve financial literacy, and unlock the most value from their financial products.

| Challenge Area | How VisionFi Addresses It |
|:---------------|:--------------------------|
| **Smart Shopping Planner** | A personalized offer engine that matches merchant deals to the user's spending history and card portfolio — inspired by Capital One Shopping. Users see offers from Whole Foods, Amazon, Target, Uber, and more with auto-activated cashback. |
| **Budget-Aware Recommendations** | Shopping recommendations are filtered through the user's real-time budget status — only surfacing deals in categories where they have remaining budget flexibility (< 70% spent). |
| **Personalized Offer Matching** | The system analyzes the last 100 transactions to identify top merchants and spending categories, then ranks offers by relevance — so each user sees deals tailored to their actual habits. |
| **Financial Literacy Hub** | A gamified **Learn** module with structured courses (Budgeting 101, Investing Basics, Credit Mastery), interactive quizzes, curated blog articles, daily challenges, an XP/leveling system, and achievement badges — making financial education engaging and sticky. |
| **Debt Payoff Intelligence** | Loan tracking with EMI schedules, interest rate comparisons, and remaining balance projections — helping users optimize their payoff strategy across student loans, auto loans, personal loans, and mortgages. |

<br/>

### 🧪 Dedalus Labs — *"Best Use of the Dedalus SDK"*

> **Challenge:** Demonstrate creative, impactful use of the Dedalus Labs SDK for multi-model AI orchestration — showing how routing across different LLMs can produce results no single model achieves alone.

| Challenge Area | How VisionFi Addresses It |
|:---------------|:--------------------------|
| **Multi-Model Orchestration Pipeline** | The **Smart Spending Orchestrator** is VisionFi's killer feature. It chains three different AI models in sequence through the Dedalus SDK, with each model handling the task it's best suited for: |
| | **Step 1 → Claude Haiku** *(speed)* — Rapid transaction categorization and spending breakdown across all user accounts. |
| | **Step 2 → GPT-4o-mini** *(cost-effective analysis)* — Pattern detection across spending, subscriptions, and credit utilization to surface hidden trends. |
| | **Step 3 → Claude Sonnet** *(reasoning quality)* — Synthesizes outputs from Steps 1 & 2 to generate actionable, personalized financial advice with a savings roadmap. |
| **Intelligent Fallback** | If the Dedalus SDK is unavailable, the system gracefully degrades to direct Anthropic API calls (Claude Sonnet for all steps) — ensuring zero downtime. |
| **Model Handoff Visibility** | The UI shows users the live orchestration pipeline — which model is running, what task it's performing, and timing metrics — making the multi-model approach transparent and educational. |
| **Goal-Oriented AI Chat** | The chat assistant uses Dedalus-routed models for different conversation phases: quick classification for intent detection, deeper reasoning for personalized financial planning, and fast models for follow-up Q&A. |
